# 5 Wire NMEA 2000 Pinout connector

This pin mapping is based ont the male connector of a 5-wire NMEA 2000 cable, which because we have colored wires and 
can do a connetivity test on that, then we just connected those wires to a T-connector, which will allow us to do a 
connectivity test for the female connector as well.

### ðŸ”Œ Expected Voltage Levels

Assuring oneself of which pin is which is important â€” especially when you're working with an unfamiliar cable or connector.
One reliable way to verify the pinout is by measuring voltage levels with a multimeter while the NMEA 2000 network is powered.

| Between Pins                      | Expected Voltage | Description                    |

| V+      â†”  V-     | \~12V DC      | Bus supply voltage                                |
| CAN\_H  â†”  CAN\_L | \~1â€“2V DC     | Differential CAN signal (fluctuates with traffic) |
| CAN\_H  â†”  V-     | \~2.5â€“3.5V DC | CAN High line idle voltage                        |
